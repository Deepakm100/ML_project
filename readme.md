## Projects

### Loan Status Prediction

This project involves predicting the status of a loan application based on various features of the applicant and the loan itself.

**Dataset:** [Loan Prediction Dataset](Loan_Status_prediction/loan_status.csv)

### Sonar Rock and Mine Prediction

This project aims to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar returns.

**Dataset:** [Sonar Mines vs. Rocks Dataset](mine_and_rock_prediction/Copy%20of%20sonar%20data.csv)

### Diabetes Prediction

This project involves predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

**Dataset:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](Diabetes_prediction/diabetes.csv)

### House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the prices of houses based on various features of the house and its location.

**Dataset:** [California House Prices Dataset](House_prediction/california_housing.csv)

## Installation

To get started with these projects, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects.git
    cd ml-projects
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
